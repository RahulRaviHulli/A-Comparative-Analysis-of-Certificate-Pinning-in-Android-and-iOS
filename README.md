# A Comparative Analysis of Certificate Pinning in Android and iOS
The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of certificate pinning in Android and iOS, which is a security mechanism used to prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by verifying server certificates. The study compares the effectiveness of certificate pinning in both platforms by analysing the performance of several mobile applications with and without certificate pinning. The authors also propose a novel approach called "hybrid pinning," which combines public key pinning and domain pinning to improve security and usability.
## Methodology
The paper compares the effectiveness of certificate pinning in Android and iOS platforms. The authors used two approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of certificate pinning in Android and iOS. The first approach involved analysing 100 (Paper says 80, it was increased to 100 in a new update) popular mobile applications (50 (Paper says 40, it was increased to 50 in a new update) on each platform) to determine whether they implement certificate pinning and to assess the effectiveness of pinning. The authors analysed the network traffic of each application using a custom-built tool to capture and analyse SSL/TLS traffic. The second approach involved a user study where participants were asked to use applications with and without certificate pinning to determine the usability of the mechanism.
